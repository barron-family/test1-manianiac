# Autograding Example: Java
This example project is written in Java, and tested with Gradle/JUnit.

### The assignment
The tests are currently failing because of an output mismatch. Fixing the `System.out.println` in the main method will make the tests green.

### Setup command
N/A

### Run command
`gradle test`

### Notes
- The JDK is installed on GitHub Actions machines, so you're also able to directly invoke `javac`, `java`, or any other CLI command included in the JDK.
